# Hybrid-CNN-LSTM-Model-for-Electric-Load-Forecasting
This project implements an electric load (power consumption) forecasting system using a hybrid CNN–LSTM deep learning model. Historical smart grid power consumption data is first preprocessed by converting timestamps, normalizing values, and creating time-series sequences.
